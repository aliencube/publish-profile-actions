# Azure Web/Functions App Publish Profile Actions #

This is a GitHub Actions that retrieves or resets the publish profile of Azure Web App or Functions App in XML format.


## Inputs ##

* `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` (**Required**): Environment variable. Azure credentials for a service principal.
* `resourceGroupName` (**Required**): Resource group name.
* `appName` (**Required**): App instance name.
* `reset`: Value indicating whether to reset the publish profile or not. If omitted, it's defaulted to `false`.


## Outputs ##

* `profile`: Publish profile in XML. **NOTE**: If the `reset` parameter is set to `true`, the output value will be empty.


## Example Usages ##

**STRONGLY RECOMMENDED**: If you echo the publish profile in your GitHub Actions workflow, the `userPWD` value cannot be masked. Therefore, it's STRONGLY RECOMMENDED to reset the publish profile to minimise the chance being compromised.
